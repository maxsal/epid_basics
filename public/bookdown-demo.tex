\hypertarget{data-driven-approaches}{%
\subsection{Data-driven approaches}\label{data-driven-approaches}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There are many data-driven approaches that are used to identify confounding that are based on statistical approaches to examine associations in study data

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Stepwise regression

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Throw all suspected confounders into a model and remove those not associated with the outcome (e.g., p \textgreater{} 0.05) in a stepwise fashion
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Change-in-estimate approach (10\% rule)

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Throw all suspected confounders into a model, retain those whose removal changes the exposure -\textgreater{} outcome effect estimate by \textgreater{} 10\%
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\emph{But}} confounding is about \textbf{causal} relationships, thus it is best to identifying confounding by using causal relationships

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The observed data structure and \emph{a prior} theory or knowledge about the suspected data structure are used to identify confounding
\item
  This is better than stepwise regression or the change-in-estimate approach, which use arbitrary rules based on statistical significance
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{structural-approach}{%
\subsection{Structural approach}\label{structural-approach}}

\hypertarget{three-criteria}{%
\subsubsection{Three criteria}\label{three-criteria}}

A confounding factor must:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Be a cause of the outcome under study
\item
  Be associated with the exposure under study in the source population
\item
  Must not be caused by the exposure or disease
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{criteria-1-confounding-factor-must-cause-the-outcome-either-directly-or-indirectly}{%
\subsubsection{Criteria 1: Confounding factor must cause the outcome (either directly or indirectly)}\label{criteria-1-confounding-factor-must-cause-the-outcome-either-directly-or-indirectly}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A confounding factor must be a cause of the outcome

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    May be an actual cause of the disease
  \item
    May be a surrogate/proxy or indirect cause of the disease

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Household income as a surrogate for a milieu of social factors correlated with income
    \item
      Education as a proxy for literacy
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Prior theory or knowledge (not the data itself) is used to determine the relation of the suspected confounding factor to the outcome
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{criteria-2-confounding-factor-must-be-associated-with-the-exposure-in-the-source-population}{%
\subsubsection{Criteria 2: Confounding factor must be associated with the exposure in the source population}\label{criteria-2-confounding-factor-must-be-associated-with-the-exposure-in-the-source-population}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We can generally identify this directly from our data, however varies a bit by design
\item
  Cohort Study

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Cohort is source population. Therefore, this relationship can be determined from the observed study data.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Case-control Study

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In a C-C study, the controls are selected from the source population, however, the control group needs to be very large and have no selection bias or measurement error in order to accurately reflect the association in the source population.
  \item
    External information can be used when available, or prior knowledge.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{criteria-3-the-factor-cannot-be-caused-by-the-exposure-or-the-disease}{%
\subsubsection{Criteria 3: The factor cannot be caused by the exposure or the disease}\label{criteria-3-the-factor-cannot-be-caused-by-the-exposure-or-the-disease}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A confounding factor must not be affected by the exposure or the disease.
\item
  Two scenarios can occur here:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The factor that we think is a confounder is actually an intermediate on the causal pathway between exposure and outcome (a \textbf{mediator})
  \item
    The factor that we think is a confounder is a common outcome of the exposure and outcome of interest (a \textbf{collider})
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{intermediate-on-the-causal-pathway-mediator}{%
\subsubsection{Intermediate on the causal pathway (Mediator)}\label{intermediate-on-the-causal-pathway-mediator}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Here, low birth weight is on the causal pathway from maternal smoking and perinatal mortality
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{img/confounding/mediator_example} 

}

\caption{Example of mediator}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-10}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Low birth weight is a \textbf{mediator}. Adjusting for a mediator is referred to as ``over-adjustment''
\end{itemize}

Another example: Fluoridation, Diet sugar, and Tooth decay

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{img/confounding/overadjusting_example} 

}

\caption{Example of a collider}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-11}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{confounding-is-structural}{%
\subsubsection{Confounding is structural}\label{confounding-is-structural}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Confounding arises because of how, structurally, the variables are related to each other

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Either how they are naturally related to each other, or, how they are related to each other after an investigator has changed the relationships by adjustmnet, matching, conditioning, etc.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

How do we know what the proper structural relationships are?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    NOT a method of data analysis
  \item
    They are used to IDENTIFY confounders based on the assumptions we are willing to make
  \end{itemize}
\item
  DAGs help us to depict the assumed temporal structure of the relationships between our factors

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Both in the state of nature
  \item
    And after investigators have intervened on the natural structure by conditioning on a set of factors
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

So

\caption{Example of confounding}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-12}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We want exchangeability of those with low vs.~non-low income, condition on having a mother with diabetes (conditional exchangeability)
\item
  The goal is to block all backdoor paths from the exposure to the outcome on the DAG
\end{itemize}

There are three broad types of systematic error in epidemiologic studies: selection bias, information bias, and confounding.

Random error differs from systematic error in that its error gets smaller as the sample size (\texttt{n}) gets larger. Systematic error does not get better with larger \texttt{n}. Selection bias is a type of systematic error.

\section{Selection bias definitions}\label{selection-bias-definitions}}

Selection bias is:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Distinct from confounding and information bias because of its mechanisms
\item
  Similar to confounding because \textbf{exchangeability} is violated

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(Pr[A=a]\) is not independent of \(Y^a\)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{definitions}{%
\subsection{Definitions}\label{definitions}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Traditional: ``Selection bias is present when individuals have different probabilities of being included (or retained) in a study sample according to relevant characteristics, namely the exposure and outcome of interest.'' (Szklo \& Nieto, 2019)
\item
  Structural: ``Bias resulting from conditioning on a common effect (a collider) of two variables, one of which is the exposure or associated with the exposure and the other is either the outcome or associated with the outcome.'' (adapted from Hern√°n, Hern√°ndez-D√≠az, \& Robbins 2004)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(A \rightarrow Y\) (A causes Y)
\item
  \(A \leftarrow C \rightarrow Y\) (A and Y share a common cause; aka confounding)
\item
  \(A \rightarrow \fbox{S} \leftarrow Y\) (A and Y share a common effect; S is a collider)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We must condition on the collider S (adjustment or restriction) or a on a descendant of a collider for us to detect a statistical association between A and Y in this scenario
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Selection bias DAG examples}\label{selection-bias-dag-examples}}

There are some more complex ways that selection bias can be captured in a DAG.

\caption{Examples of selection bias in DAGs}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-21}
\end{figure}

In Fig. 3.3.a., conditioning on the collider, C, opens a backdoor pathway between the exposure, A, and the outcome, Y. This path is \(A \leftarrow W \rightarrow \fbox{C} \leftarrow L \leftarrow U \rightarrow Y\).

In Fig. 3.3.b., conditioning on C, the descendant of the collider, L, opens a backdoor path.

Here is a motivational example that displays the intuition behind a collider.

\(\text{Rain} \rightarrow \fbox{ Wet sidewalk } \leftarrow \text{Neighbor's sprinkler}\)

Take, for example, the question: did it rain last night? Suppose we only observe when the sidewalk is wet. The sidewalk could be wet for two reasons: (1) it rained or (2) your neighbor ran the sprinkler. If we know the sidewalk is wet and that the neighbor's sprinkler is broken, then it probably rained. Knowing information about one of the causes of a collider gives us information about the other.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There are many ways a study can be subject to selection bias
\item
  Learning about well accepted types of selection bias can help with finding it in our own studies

  ``Berkson's bias''

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Particularly relevant for hospital-based case-control studies
  \item
    Occurs when \textbf{controls are not selected independent of exposure}
  \item
    Case-control studies are thought to be particularly susceptible to selection bias because at the very least \(Y \rightarrow \fbox{S}\)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Take the DAG in Fig. 3.4.b to represent a hospital-based case-control study of the malnutrition (A) on depression (Y). Because of the study design, those with depression (Y) are more likely to be included in the study (C). Malnutrition by itself is likely to cause somebody to be admitted to the hospital (C). This is called ``Berkson's Bias.''

\hypertarget{selection-bias-in-cohort-studies}{%
\subsubsection{Selection bias in cohort studies}\label{selection-bias-in-cohort-studies}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Selection bias in cohort studies typically arises because of \textbf{loss to follow-up} or mortality related to both the outcome and the exposure.
\end{itemize}

Take the DAG in Fig. 3.3.a to represent a cohort study of occupational exposure (A) on risk of stroke (Y). The terrible work conditions of the job (W) is a common cause of exposure (A) and likelihood that a person will quit (C). Underlying health status (U) is a cause of stroke (Y) and causes a person to quit (C) through deteriorating physical health (L). This is also called the ``healthy worker effect.''

\item

\item
  Prevalent cases with better prognosis or underlying health are more likely to show up in your study.
\end{itemize}

Take the DAG in Fig. 3.4.b to represent a study of the effect of folic acid (A) at conception on the prevalence of birth defects (Y). Only those babies born were included in the study (C).

  RCTs are often thought to be the ``gold standard'' of causal inference
\item
  While they are less likely to be subject to confounding, they are equally likely to be subject to selection bias due to loss to follow-up.
\end{itemize}

Take the DAG in Fig. 3.3.b to represent a study of AZT (A) on development on AIDS (Y). Treatment A and illness severity (U) both cause side effects (L) which leads to dropout (C).

One of the most important analysis related methods to deal with confounding is multiple regression analysis.

The most important methods are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Linear regression for continuous outcomes
\item
  Logistic regression for binary outcomes
\item
  Cox regression for time-to-event data, and
\item
  Poisson regression for frequencies and rates
\end{itemize}

Other methods are, for example, stratification, the use of instrumental variables, or the application of propensity scores. In this chapter, an overview of the most important multiple regression models is given with a focus on applications in modern epidemiology.

\hypertarget{linear-regression}{%
\section{Linear regression}\label{linear-regression}}

The use of simple linear regression is possible if the effect of one continuous explanatory variable X, for example, Body mass index measured in kilograms per square meter on one continuous response variable Y, for example, systolic blood pressure measured in millimeters of Hg is to be investigated. The fundamental model equation is given by

\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \epsilon
\]

where \(\beta_0\) is the intercept, \(\beta_1\) is the regression coefficient for \(X\), \(x\) is the observed value for \(X\), and \(\epsilon\) is the random error describing individual deviations from the mean of \(Y\) given \(X=x\), also called the residual term.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{img/regression/univariate_regression} 

}

\caption{An example of a univariate regression analysis}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-23}
\end{figure}

The ordinary least squares estimates of the parameters \(\beta_1\) and \(\beta_0\) are given by

\[
\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i-\bar{x})^2}
\]

and

\[
\beta_0 = \bar{y}-\hat{\beta}_1\bar{x}
\]

where \(\bar(x)\) and \(\bar(y)\) are the arithmetic means of \(x_i\) and \(y_i\), \(i=1,...,n\), respectively.

In summary, the goal of regression models are threefold:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  To determine whether the variables \(Y\) and \(X\) are systematically related (test of \(H_0:\beta_1=0\)).
\item
  To estimate the effect size of \(X\) on \(Y\) by means of \(\hat{\beta}_1\) (complemented by a 95\% confidence interval)
\item
  To predict the expected value of \(Y\) for given values of \(X\) (with 95\% confidence interval)
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{multiple-linear-regression}{%
\section{Multiple linear regression}\label{multiple-linear-regression}}

Simple linear regression plays a negligible role in epidemiology for two reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Binary (logistic) and time-to-event (Cox) outcomes are much more common than continuous response variables
\item
  The effects of \textbf{confounders} have to be taken into account, so that multiple linear regression should be applied even if we are interested mainly in the effect of one primary explanatory variable. The multiple linear regression model is an extension of the univariate linear regression model where instead of only one explanatory variable \(X\) several explanatory variables \(X_1,...,X_k\) with observed values \(x_1,...x_k\) are considered. The fundamental model equation is given by
\end{enumerate}

\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ... + \beta_k x_k + \epsilon
\]

As mentioned above, we can test whether th explanatory variable \(X_j (j=1, ..., k)\) has a significant effect on the response \(Y\), we can describe the estimated effect size of \(X_j\) by means of \(\hat{\beta}_j\) for \(j=1,...,k\) (with CIs), and we can predict the expected value of \(Y\) for given values of \(X_1, ... X_k\) (with CIs).

This model can describe the effects of several explanatory variables simultaneously and the regression coefficient \(\beta_j\) represents the effect for \(X_j\) adjusted for all other explanatory variables. In general, it is misleading to assess the associations of the response \(Y\) and several explanatory variables by means of several simple linear regression models.
